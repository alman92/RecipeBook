1. Why did you choose this technology?
   
   We chose this because this is a framework that covers front-end and back-end, which uses MongoDB and Node.js. The Meteor site provides good documentation. 
   
   
2. What problem does it solve?
   
   Data on the wire - the server sends the data instead of html and the client renders it. 
   
   It achieves clean and dry code. 
   
   Avoid constant installations and multiple applications (ie nodemon, mongo, mongodb)
    

3. Why does one use it? 

    One would use it because it only requires Javascript and it creates full-stack web applications. 
    

4. What is the history of Meteor? 
  
    Meteor was a free and open-source javascript framework that was developed by the Meteor Development Group that was incubated by Y Combinator.
    
    Meteor was released in December 2011 under the name Skybreak. 
    
    
 5. What is your opinion of the technology after having built something with it?
 
    Meteor allows you to have front-end packages, such as "autoform, meteortoys", that create forms.
